## Project Description :page_facing_up:

This project is part of the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp from TecnolÃ³gico de Monterrey. In this assignment, the task was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. In order to achive the goal it is necessary to generate tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study, and a summary of the study results.

ðŸ¤“ This Project is the result of the learning lessons of Module 5: Data Visualization from the Data Analysis and Visualization Bootcamp 2024. The main goal is to use the acquired habilities and knowledge in a real case. 

## Table of contents :point_right:

On the repository you'll find a folder named PyCitySchools, which contains:

| Item  |   File Type          |         File Name              |           Description                                                            |
| ----- | -------------------  | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |
|   1   | Jupyter Notebook     |  Pymaceuticals                 |  Jupyter notebook with answers to the exercise                                   |
|   2   | Jupyter Notebook     |   Pymaceuticals_starter        | Jupyter notebook with the starter code of the task                               |
|   3   |   Markdown file      |           Analysis             | The markdown compiles the results of the analysis and the main conclusions       |
|   4   |   folder             |          Data                  | Contains 2 csv files: 4.1) Mouse_metadata.csv and 4.2) Study_results.csv         |

## How to Use the Project

* To solve the problem, you can use the starter code and the compare the answers with the Jupyter Notebook that contains the answers.
